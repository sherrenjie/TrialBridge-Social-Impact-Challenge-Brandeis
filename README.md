## What is TrialBridge?

TrialBridge is a platform that helps women find clinical trials that match their health needs. We make it easy to discover and connect with research opportunities that can improve healthcare for all women.

---

## Why This Matters

Women have been historically underrepresented in medical research, and this impacts their healthcare:

- **7.9 million** women are misdiagnosed each year in the U.S.
- Women are **66% more likely** to be misdiagnosed than men
- Only **33%** of clinical trial participants are women
- Women wait an average of **7-10 years** for an endometriosis diagnosis
- Only **1%** of healthcare research funding goes to women's health (beyond cancer)

For decades, women were excluded from clinical trials because researchers claimed hormones would "skew" results. We're here to change that.

## How It Works

1. **Answer Questions** - Complete a simple questionnaire about your health, location, and preferences
2. **Get Matched** - Our platform searches ClinicalTrials.gov to find trials that match your profile
3. **Review Results** - See trial details, locations, eligibility requirements, and contact information
4. **Take Action** - Connect directly with research teams or learn more on ClinicalTrials.gov
